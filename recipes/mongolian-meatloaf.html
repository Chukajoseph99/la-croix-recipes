    <h2>Mongolian Meatloaf</h2>
    <p>I could not be more pleased with how this Mongolian Meatloaf experiment turned out. Since I could not decide whether to make meatloaf or Mongolian beef, I decided to try both things at once. The result is a tender meatloaf, sliced and crisped in a skillet and served with a sweet, salty, savory sauce, which, like the American Chinese restaurant favorite, Mongolian Beef, is not remotely Mongolian. But it sure is delicious, especially served over steamed rice with bok choy.</p>
    <p>I am kind of a fan of P.F. Changs. Its not a place I crave if I am in a city like San Francisco, but if I amm stranded with few good options in a mall in rural Upstate New York, like I was so many times while visiting my mom, it was a welcomed respite to the usual food court fare. I will also admit to using a P.F. Changs copycat Mongolian beef recipe I found many years ago in the occasional stir-fry. Its that simple, sweet, salty sauce which found its way on top of this meatloaf mash-up. </p>
    <p> As I mentioned, Mongolian beef (or Mongolian meatloaf) has absolutely nothing to do with Mongolian cuisine. Apparently, its a Taiwanese dish that made its way to American-Chinese restaurants. But, horribly inaccurate names aside, this is an easy-to-make flavor bomb. I loved how this came out. You can easily adapt this to other ground meats (I think lamb, pork, chicken, or turkey would all work beautifully). Regardless of what you use, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy! </p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly oil a loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and saut√© yellow onions with a pinch of salt until they start to turn golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cloves crushed garlic and 2 teaspoons ginger, and cook for 1 minute more. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cooled onion mixture to ground beef along with egg, green onions, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, salt, and black pepper. Use a fork, spatula, or your hands to mix together until evenly combined. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan, press in firmly, and smooth the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C). Meatloaf can be served hot, or let cool, wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>For the sauce, combine 2 teaspoons oil, 1 tablespoon ginger, and 4 minced garlic cloves in a cold nonstick skillet.</li>
        <li>Turn heat on to medium-high. Once ginger and garlic start to sizzle, cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds, then whisk in brown sugar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup water, ketchup, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1 teaspoon cornstarch with 2 teaspoons water togehter in a small bowl to make a slurry; stir into the sauce. Raise heat to medium-high and return to a simmer. Cook, whisking occasionally, until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and keep warm until needed (Sauce may be made ahead and reheated on medium-low heat).</li>
        <li>Remove cold meatloaf from the refrigerator and slice into 8 portions. Dust each side with cornstarch, and reheat over medium high heat in a nonstick skillet in a little bit of vegetable oil until browned and heated through. If surface browns before meatloaf is heated through, reduce heat to medium, and cover until done.</li>
        <li>Serve topped with the sauce; garnish with toasted sesame seeds, sliced green onions, and chopped cilantro if desired.</li>
    </ol>
